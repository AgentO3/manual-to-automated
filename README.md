Building a Culture of ShipIt!
===================

- Why don't we ship?
  - Don't have tools installed
  - Afraid to break something
  - Perfectionists
- Why should we ship often?
  - Code rots fast
  - No ROI until it's in production
  - It's satisfying
- What's the deal with deployments?
  - Commandline tools are hard to setup
  - They are anti-social
  - Too much automation steals the glory
- What can we do?
  - Use ChatOps
    - It makes tools accessible
    - It makes deployment social thing
  - Every deployment is an epic
    - Give us the satisfaction of pushing the button
    - Celebrate your achivements
  - Use feature flags
    - Allows you to merge code in early
    - Then hide it until it does not suck
  - Problem detection over problem prevention
    - Pingdom to make sure everything is up
    - Kibana to aggratate and grok your logs
    - Airbrake to monitor frontend exceptions
- Deep Thoughts
  - Deployment is more than just pushing code
  - Every deployment is a victory

Building a Culture of ShipIt!
===================

- Why don't we ship enough?
  - Don't have tools installed
  - Afraid to break something
  - Perfectionists
  - Not my job
- Why should we ship often?
  - Code rots fast
  - No ROI on code until it's in production
  - Customers and stakeholders like to see progress
  - Hard to know your code works right without a production workload and data
  - Nothing makes us happier then seeing our work being used
- What's the deal with deployments?
  - Commandline tools are hard to setup
  - Also they don't scale well to teams
  - It's anti-social
- What can we do to make deployments awesome?
  - Use ChatOps
    - It makes tools accessible to all
    - It makes deployments social thing
  - Every deployment is epic
    - Give us the satisfaction of pushing the button
    - Celebrate like it's a rocket to the moon
  - Use feature flags
    - Allows you to merge code in early
    - Then hide it
    - Iterate until it sucks less
  - Problem detection over problem prevention
    - Pingdom to alert you when your down
    - Kibana to aggratate and grok your logs
    - Airbrake to monitor frontend exceptions
- Final Thoughts
  - Deployment should be social event
  - It's a victory, so celebrate!
  - Allow us to deploy when we are ready not when the code is ready
  - Problems will happen, so make sure you can find them fast
  - When deployment is fun and easy, we will ship allot!

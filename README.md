Building a Culture of ShipIt!
===================

- Why don't we ship enough?
  - Don't have tools installed
  - Afraid to break something
  - Perfectionists
  - Not my job
- Why should we ship often?
  - Code rots fast
  - No ROI on code until it's in production
  - Customers and stakeholders like to see progress
  - Hard to know your code works right without a production workload and data
  - Nothing makes us happier than seeing our work being used
- What's the deal with deployments?
  - Commandline tools are hard to setup
  - Also they don't scale well past a couple of team members
  - It's anti-social, unless your pair programming
- What can we do to make deployments awesome?
  - Use ChatOps
    - It makes tools accessible to all
    - It makes deployments social thing
  - Every deployment is epic
    - Give us the satisfaction of pushing the button
    - Celebrate like it's a rocket to the moon
  - Use feature flags
    - Allows you to merge code in early
    - Then hide it from public eyes
    - Iterate until it sucks less
  - Problem detection over problem prevention
    - Testing is good, but it can slow you down from building features
    - 100% code coverage will never prevent all bugs
    - Whem moving fast concentrate on tools to help you discover problems
      - Pingdom to alert you when your down
      - Kibana to aggregate and grok your logs
      - Airbrake to monitor frontend exceptions
- Final Thoughts
  - Deployment should be social event
  - It's a victory, so celebrate!
  - Allow us to deploy when we are ready not when the code is ready
  - Problems will happen, so make sure you can find them fast
  - When deployment is fun and easy, we will ship allot!
